    <p style="font-size:120%;">Thank God it's Fall, right? Have there ever been times in your life where it is the perfect weather outside, seventy and sunny, and you have no idea what to do? Well, fret no more as here are five ideas for you to choose from on what to do on a fall day!</p>
<br>
<br>

    <h1>Pumpkin Patch</h1>
    <img src="images/1491593504648.jpeg" alt="Pumpkin Patch" style="width:340px;height:280px;float:right; margin-left: 10px;">
    <p style="font-size:150%;">The most common activity that is seen on social media is going to pumpkin patches. This is an activity that can be done alone or with others of your choosing! Most pumpkin patches do not have you simply shopping for gourds anymore, but places like Raider Farms in Normal, Illinois also have a small gift shop, snacks, a corn maze, and different areas for kids to play!</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: right;">Corn Maze</h1>
    <img src="images/unnamed.jpg" alt="Corn Maze" style="width:400px;height:300px;float:left; margin-right: 10px;">
    <p style="font-size:150%; text-align: right;">As previously mentioned, corn mazes can also be found at various pumpkin patches, as well as by themselves for those who are up to the challenge! Some corn mazes can be quite scary with people jumping out at you or in the dark, but like this maze on the left, some are difficult, long, and fun! The mazes with this level of difficulty are for those who have done more than a few mazes. This one can be found at Richardson Adventure Farm in Illinois!</p>

    <h1>Bonfires</h1>
    <img src="images/bonfire-safety-blog.jpg" alt="A Bonfire" style="width:400px;height:330px;float: right;margin-left: 10px;">
    <p style="font-size:150%">As it starts cooling down at night, the best way to warm up is next to a cozy campfire! The best campfires have comfy chairs, a raging fire, s'mores, and a great group of friends. Campfires can be done safely by having a firepit, the chairs and people a safe distance away from the fire, and not throwing things into the pit that will pop out when heated up.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: right;">Tailgating</h1>
    <img src="images/846819354.0.jpg" alt="Football Tailgating" style="Width:340px;height:300px;float: left;margin-right: 10px;">
    <p style="font-size:150%; text-align: right;">Tailgating is not just for those who like sports or know the football event you are tailgating at. Tailgating is all about having fun with the people around you. When you tailgate, there are typically chips, hot dogs, burgers, bags (or cornhole if you prefer), beer pong, and beer in general. You don't even need a ticket to the game you are sitting outside of to tailgate! Everyone brings something, similar to a potluck, even if it is your own alcohol! Tailgates are commonly known around college and NFL football games. The goal when going to a tailgate is to relax, have fun, and drink! The next tailgate I will be participating in is the Illinois versus Wisconsin football game on Saturday, October eighth! If you are a fan of football though, there are still tickets on sale!</p>

    <h1>Haunted Houses</h1>
    <img src="images/hba.jpeg" alt="Baldwin Asylum" style="width:370px;height:320px;float:right; margin-left: 10px">
    <p style="font-size: 150%;">And for our final fall-tastic list is haunted houses! If you are a little more daring, myself included, when fall comes around, all you can think about is spooky season! I may not dress up and go trick-or-treating anymore, but my real treat is spending money to go to haunted houses. Haunted houses range in variety from not as scary to multi-level, I'm going to pee my pants scary. I like the multi-level scary and I found a group of friends that also do, so it is a match made in heaven on Halloween! A favorite hanuted house, more of a haunted asylum, that I have been to was the Baldwin Asylum in Rantoul, Illinois! It is not super kid friendly, so I would not reccommend it for a good fashioned family outing.</p>
